# Sample Processed Data for LSS-SM Framework

This repository includes a sample from the dataset used in the case study for the Lean Six Sigma with Sustainable Manufacturing (LSS-SM) framework paper.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

- **sample_processed_data.csv**: A sample of 10 records from the processed manufacturing dataset.
- **columns_description.txt**: Description of each column in the dataset.
- **analysis_script.ipynb**: (Optional) Python/Jupyter Notebook used for exploratory and regression analysis.

- `Material_Usage`: Raw material consumed (kg or units).
- `Waste_Generated`: Waste produced (kg of defects or scrap).
- `Carbon_Emissions`: CO‚ÇÇ emissions estimated (kg CO‚ÇÇ equivalent).
- `Production_Capacity`: Units produced in the recorded interval.
- `Reconfiguration_Time`: Setup/changeover time (minutes).
- `Downtime`: Unplanned downtime (minutes).
- `AI_Optimization_Applied`: Whether AI-based optimization was used (Yes/No).
- `IoT_Enabled`: Whether IoT monitoring was active (Yes/No).
- `Predictive_Maintenance`: Whether predictive maintenance was used (Yes/No).
- `Digital_Twin_Used`: Whether digital twin models were used (Yes/No).
